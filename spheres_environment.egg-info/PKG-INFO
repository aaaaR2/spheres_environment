# Spheres virtual environment

This Python package provides a framework for a virtual environment in which 
spherical objects interact in a 3D space. This is primarily intended for use in 
the development of behavioral tasks for experimental science.

## Installation

The package can be used as-is, so long as the [Python path] is set 
appropriately.
                 
However, `pyoproject.toml` and `setup.cfg` files have been provided, to 
facilitate package installation via [setuptools]. Package installation can be 
accomplished via the [pip install] command:

```
pip install path/to/spheres_environment
```

The update, user, and editable / development flags are common options that can 
be added to the command:

```
pip install -e -U --user path/to/spheres_environment
```

### Testing

Forthcoming.

## Example

Initialize an environment instance.

```python
>>> import spheres_environment
>>> environment = spheres_environment.Environment()

```

Add a pair of spheres to the environment.

```python
>>> sphere_a = environment.initialize_object('sphere_a')
>>> sphere_b = environment.initialize_object('sphere_b')

```

Verify that the spheres overlap, given the default property values.

```python
>>> def spheres_are_overlapping():
...     p_a = sphere_a.position
...     p_b = sphere_b.position
...     d = sum([(p_b[k] - p_a[k])**2 for k in ['x', 'y', 'z']])
...     return d <= (sphere_a.radius + sphere_b.radius)**2
>>> spheres_are_overlapping()
True

```

Change the position of `sphere_b` and verify that it still overlaps 
with `sphere_a`.

```python
>>> sphere_b.position = (1, 1, 1)
>>> spheres_are_overlapping()
True

```

Decrease the radius of `sphere_a` and confirm that the two spheres no 
longer overlap.

```python
>>> sphere_a.radius = 0.1
>>> spheres_are_overlapping()
False

```

At its core, the environment and all objects in the environment are 
structured as Python mapping data types. The current state of the 
environment can be represented, completely, by converting all objects 
in the environment into dict records.

```python
>>> records = [o.data for o in environment.values()]
>>> import pprint
>>> pprint.pp(records)
[{'position/x': 0.0,
  'position/y': 0.0,
  'position/z': 0.0,
  'radius': 0.1,
  'key': 'sphere_a'},
 {'position/x': 1.0,
  'position/y': 1.0,
  'position/z': 1.0,
  'radius': 1.0,
  'key': 'sphere_b'}]

```

this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its

to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.
